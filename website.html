    <tittle pargraph>Daffodils:                           <Summary></Summary></tittle><br>
    <pr>The poem is written by William Wordsworth an American poet. Who was also a romantic poet. Due to his love for
        nature, most of his poems describe nature and its beauty. One day poet was travelling along the countryside when
        he came across a large number of daffodils. These flowers were growing at the bank of the river. These were
        dancing and moving I the breeze. The sight delighted the poet and he looked at these flowers for a long time.
        The poets and writers have actually a world of imagination. They think beyond that world. The poet feels
        pleasure in the company of daffodils.

        “Beside the lake beneath the tree, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze”.

        The sight of pretty yellow daffodils delighted the poet. So that whenever he is alone in thinking mode the same
        sight come in his mind and his heart fills with pleasure. Natural beauty and the color of nature are the real
        and permanent source of pleasure for the poet. He feels very relax and his all tension disappear from his mind,
        whenever the sight of daffodils come to his mind. Nature and its beauty left an everlasting impression on poet
        imagination. Natural beauty is a source of attraction for the poet. The poet feels happiness in the company of
        daffodils and these flowers have become a permanent source of spiritual joy for the poet.

        “Nature is a guiding mother”.

        The most common effect of nature on our mind is that it removes or reduces our stress level and lead us to the
        height of imagination, which is actually a heaven for all the poets and writers.

        “Nature does require her time for Preservation”

        The scene of daffodils saved in the memory of the poet that after few years passing poet can recall these
        memories in his solitude. He can visualize their beauty as they were there in reality. That is the magic of the
        poet.</pr>

    <b>1.Followship Point </b><br>
    About this Book:<br>
    NATIONAL BESTSELLER

    “Engrossing...studded with wisdom about long-held bonds.” —People, Book of the Week
    “Enthralling, masterfully written...rich with social and psychological insights.” —The New York Times Book Review
    “A magnificent storytelling feat.” —The Boston Globe

    The “utterly engrossing, sweeping” (Time) story of a lifelong friendship between two very different “superbly
    depicted” (The Wall Street Journal) women with shared histories, divisive loyalties, hidden sorrows, and eighty
    years of summers on a pristine point of land on the coast of Maine, set across the arc of the 20th century.

    Celebrated children’s book author Agnes Lee is determined to secure her legacy—to complete what she knows will be
    the final volume of her pseudonymously written Franklin Square novels; and even more consuming, to permanently
    protect the peninsula of majestic coast in Maine known as Fellowship Point. To donate the land to a trust, Agnes
    must convince shareholders to dissolve a generations-old partnership. And one of those shareholders is her best
    friend, Polly.

    Polly Wister has led a different kind of life than Agnes: that of a well-off married woman with children, defined by
    her devotion to her husband, a philosophy professor with an inflated sense of stature. She strives to create beauty
    and harmony in her home, in her friendships, and in her family. Polly soon finds her loyalties torn between the
    wishes of her best friend and the wishes of her three sons—but what is it that Polly wants herself?

    Agnes’s designs are further muddied when an enterprising young book editor named Maud Silver sets out to convince
    Agnes to write her memoirs. Agnes’s resistance cannot prevent long-buried memories and secrets from coming to light
    with far-reaching repercussions for all.

    “An ambitious and satisfying tale” (The Washington Post), Fellowship Point reads like a 19th-century epic, but it is
    entirely contemporary in its “reflections on aging, writing, stewardship, legacies, independence, and
    responsibility. At its heart, Fellowship Point is about caring for the places and people we love...This magnificent
    novel affirms that change and growth are possible at any age” (The Christian Science Monitor).<br>

    <b>3.Silent Invasion</b><br>
    About this Book:<br>
    Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia is a 2018 book by Clive Hamilton and is about the growing influence
    of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Australian politics and civil society. The book details the systematic
    attempt by the government of the People's Republic of China to expand its espionage network and influence in
    Australia.[1] The author alleges that this is causing "the erosion of Australian sovereignty".[2]In the book's
    initial publication in November 2017 was delayed due to legal concerns by the initial publishers, Allen & Unwin,
    that they “would be targeted by Beijing and its proxies in Australia.” The book was published after Hardie Grant
    Books agreed to publish the book.[2][3].The Chinese translation is not available in Simplified Chinese but available
    in Traditional Chinese, and it was published by Zuoan Wenhua Publishing as Silent Invasion: The China Factor in
    Australia (無聲的入侵：中國因素在澳洲; ISBN 9789865727833) on March 20, 2019.[4].The Japanese translation was published by Asuka
    Shinsha Publishing as Invisible Invasion: The China’s Campaign to Control Australia (目に見えぬ侵略 中国のオーストラリア支配計画; ISBN
    978-4-86410-747-1) on May 28, 2020.[5]<br>

    <b>4.Lapvona </b><br>
    About this Book:<br>
    ABOUT LAPVONA
    An Instant New York Times Bestseller!

    “Lapvona flips all the conventions of familial and parental relations, putting hatred where love should be or a
    negotiation where grief should be . . . Through a mix of witchery, deception, murder, abuse, grand delusion,
    ludicrous conversations, and cringeworthy moments of bodily disgust, Moshfegh creates a world that you definitely
    don’t want to live in, but from which you can’t look away.” —The Atlantic

    In a village in a medieval fiefdom buffeted by natural disasters, a motherless shepherd boy finds himself the
    unlikely pivot of a power struggle that puts all manner of faith to a savage test, in a spellbinding novel that
    represents Ottessa Moshfegh’s most exciting leap yet

    Little Marek, the abused and delusional son of the village shepherd, never knew his mother; his father told him she
    died in childbirth. One of life’s few consolations for Marek is his enduring bond with the blind village midwife,
    Ina, who suckled him when he was a baby, as she did so many of the village’s children. Ina’s gifts extend beyond
    childcare: she possesses a unique ability to communicate with the natural world. Her gift often brings her the
    transmission of sacred knowledge on levels far beyond those available to other villagers, however religious they
    might be. For some people, Ina’s home in the woods outside of the village is a place to fear and to avoid, a godless
    place. <br>

    <b>5.In On The Jok</b><br>
    About this Book:<br>
    “A sensitive and vivid study of early female stand-ups… [Levy is a] painstaking, knowledgeable guide.” —New York
    Times Book Review

    A hilarious and moving account of the trailblazing women of stand-up comedy who broke down walls so they could stand
    before the mic—perfect for fans of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Hacks

    Today, women are ascendant in stand-up comedy, even preeminent. They make headlines, fill arenas, spawn blockbuster
    movies. But before Amy Schumer slayed, Tiffany Haddish killed, and Ali Wong drew roars, the very idea of a female
    comedian seemed, to most of America, like a punch line. And it took a special sort of woman—indeed, a parade of
    them—to break and remake the mold.

    In on the Joke is the story of a group of unforgettable women who knocked down the doors of stand-up comedy so other
    women could get a shot. It spans decades, from Moms Mabley’s rise in Black vaudeville between the world wars, to the
    roadhouse ribaldry of Belle Barth and Rusty Warren in the 1950s and ’60s, to Elaine May’s co-invention of improv
    comedy, to Joan Rivers’s and Phyllis Diller’s ferocious ascent to mainstream stardom. These women refused to be
    defined by type and tradition, facing down indifference, puzzlement, nay-saying, and unvarnished hostility. They
    were discouraged by agents, managers, audiences, critics, fellow performers—even their families. And yet they
    persevered against the tired notion that women couldn’t be funny, making space not only for themselves, but for the
    women who followed them.<br>

    <b>6.Shes Nice Though</b><br>
    About this Book:<br>
    “And, at the center of it all, am I actually nice or am I just performing a role I think I’m expected to play?” Mia
    Mercado is a razor-sharp cultural critic and essayist known for her witty and hilarious dissections of the
    uncomfortable truths that rule our lives. In this thought-provoking collection of new essays, Mercado examines what
    it means to be “polite,” “agreeable,” and “nice.” She covers topics from the subtleties of the “Bad Bitch” and why
    women dominate the ASMR market, to what makes her dog an adorable little freak and how you know if you’re shy. This
    is a book about the unspoken trick mirror of our “good” intentions: the inherent performance of the social media
    apology, celebrating men when they do the bare minimum, and why we trust a Midwesterner to watch our stuff when we
    go pee.

    Throughout, she ponders her identity as an Asian woman and asks what “nice” even means—and why anyone would want to
    be it. With writing that is as precise as it is profound, and cultural references that range from trash reality
    television to the New York Times Sunday-morning crossword puzzle, Mercado uncovers weird, long-overdue truths about
    our frailties and failings. In the end, she sees them not as a source of shame but as a cause for celebration.
    Filled with revelations that range from the silly to the serious,

    She’s Nice Though offers a mind-bending glimpse into the illusions and delusions of contemporary life.<br>
